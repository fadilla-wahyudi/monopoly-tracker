# Monopoly Money Tracker
This script keeps track of players' money in Monopoly.

## Background
So our family owns the "Monopoly - Here & Now World Edition" where players use cards, instead of cash, to make transactions. Unfortunately for us, our card reader stopped working.
When I began to learn Python, I thought it would be a cool idea to create a script that can keep track of everyone's money. Suffice to say, it did its job but it was primitive.
I have made a more updated version. Enjoy!
